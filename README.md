## Treasure Island
Welcome to the Treasure Island game! This is a simple text-based adventure game where your goal is to find the hidden treasure.

# Project Description
The Treasure Island game is a fun and interactive way to experience a treasure hunt. Navigate through different choices to reach the treasure, but beware of the traps and dangers along the way. Each decision you make will affect your journey, and only the correct choices will lead you to the treasure.

# Instructions
Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.

# Text Snippets
If you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below:

'You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
'You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
"You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
"It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
"You found the treasure! You Win!"
"You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
"You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
"You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
"You fell into a hole. Game Over."

# Escaping Characters
If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to "escape" some of them using the backslash \. For example, you can see this in my first sentence: 'You're at a crossroad...'.

# Extensions
Make the player's answers less case-sensitive. Your code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".
Add your own ASCII art. Just remember to add three single quotes ''' at the start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a multi-line string.
